# multi-restore-portal
A portal for space, capitalisation and punctuation restoration APIs.

Paste content from anywhere you like (Wikipedia, etc.). Characters to be restored are automatically removed so that they can be restored again!

Inputs are trimmed to 1000 characters to prevent overloading the APIs.
